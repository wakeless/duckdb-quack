# The Quack Client/Server Protocol for DuckDB

> Quack is released as a pre-release extension and is currently experimental. If you encounter any issues, please file them [via GitHub](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-quack/issues).

The `quack` extension adds a client-server protocol to DuckDB. With this extension, DuckDB can act as both a server and a client to communicate over a network. For more details, please see
the [announcement page](https://duckdb.org/quack),
the [blog post](https://duckdb.org/2026/05/12/quack-remote-protocol)
and the [documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/quack/overview).

## Usage Example

The Quack extensions autoinstalls and [autoloads](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/extensions/overview#autoloading-extensions) on first use.
You can also install and load it manually using:

```sql
INSTALL quack;
LOAD quack;
```

Start Quack on one DuckDB instance, the server, using:

```sql
CALL quack_serve('quack:localhost', token = 'super_secret');
CREATE TABLE hello AS FROM VALUES ('world') v(s);
```

And talk to this server from another instance:

```sql
CREATE SECRET (TYPE quack, TOKEN 'super_secret');
ATTACH 'quack:localhost' AS remote;
FROM remote.hello;
```

This should show the content of the remote table `hello` on the client side.

We can also copy data from client to server:

```sql
-- on client
CREATE TABLE remote.hello2 AS FROM VALUES ('world2') v(s);
```

```sql
-- on server
FROM hello2;
```

### Connecting lazily

`ATTACH` does not contact the server. The session handshake and the catalog snapshot happen the
first time the attachment is used, so attaching a server you never query costs nothing — which
matters for connection pools that re-run their initialisation SQL on every new pooled connection.

The trade-off is that an unreachable server or a rejected token is reported by the first query
rather than by `ATTACH`. Pass `eager_catalog` to connect straight away:

```sql
ATTACH 'quack:localhost' AS remote (EAGER_CATALOG true);
```

Because the token is resolved on first use, a secret created after `ATTACH` is still picked up —
and one dropped before first use will break an attachment that looked fine.

### Observing connection reuse

`quack_server_list()` reports `client_connections` and `client_requests` in its `info` map. Clients
hold their transport connections open across requests, so requests should climb far faster than
connections; the two rising together means something is reconnecting for every request.

## Development

### Managing dependencies
DuckDB extensions uses VCPKG for dependency management. Enabling VCPKG via the provided makefile target:
```shell
make setup-vcpkg
export VCPKG_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=`pwd`/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```

### Build steps

Now to build the extension, run:

```bash
make
```

The main binaries that will be built are:

```bash
./build/release/duckdb
./build/release/test/unittest
./build/release/extension/quack/quack.duckdb_extension
```

- `duckdb` is the binary for the duckdb shell with the extension code automatically loaded.
- `unittest` is the test runner of duckdb. Again, the extension is already linked into the binary.
- `quack.duckdb_extension` is the loadable binary as it would be distributed.

### Running the tests

Different tests can be created for DuckDB extensions. The primary way of testing DuckDB extensions should be the SQL tests in `./test/sql`. These SQL tests can be run using:

```bash
make test
```
